The e-commerce clothing website project showcase my skills in HTML,CSS, and
JavaScript for front-end development. The site features diverse clothing 
categories with detailed product listings. Despite lacking backend functionality,
this project emphasizes intuitive navigation and engaging visuals to deliver a 
seamless online shopping experience.
